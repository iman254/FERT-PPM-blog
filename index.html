      <h4 class="intro_title">What is FERT PPM?</h4>
      <p>FERT PPM is a web application me and my team of two software Engineers designed to bring uniformity in data distribution in the world of fertigation usage. It is an application that enables regulation of fertilizer being injected in plants
        to ensure correct amounts of nutrients are being utilized hence promoting quality growth of the crop. Since the fertilizers are delivered in a dissolved form, the distribution of the nutrients in the soil and other growing media is almost the
        same as the distribution of water. The app incorporates instances of soil and hydroponic use. A careful consideration of nutrient concentrations in fertigation programs is also required to contain nutrient levels within acceptable contaminant
        limits.</p>

    <h4 class="intro_title">Purpose Of FERT PPM</h4>
    <p>The main purpose of the project is to enable easy derivation of calculation and measurement of the fertilizer
      being used in a fertigation system.It saves the time of calculation by taking in fertilizer elements, Elements
      composition, amount and costs and manipulates the data to the benefits of the crops in the system by enabling


      growers have achieved the correct proportion of nutrients needed by the crop.Macro nutrients required by crops that our system focuses on include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ã˜ Calcium </li>
      <li> Ã˜ Potassium </li>
      <li> Ã˜ Phosphorus </li>
      <li> Ã˜ Magnesium </li>
      <li> Ã˜ Nitrogen </li>
      <li> Ã˜ Sulphur </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Micro nutrients required by crops include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Ã˜ Boron </li>
      <li> Ã˜ Copper </li>
      <li> Ã˜ Iron </li>
      <li> Ã˜ Molybdenum </li>
      <li> Ã˜ Manganese</li>
      <li> Ã˜ Zinc </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To let the grower have a brief understanding of the crop nutrients our system is able to solve, We included a brief introduction to the science behind crop nutrition.
      Mobile nutrients are those whose deficiency appears first on the old growth and they include: Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and Magnesium
      Slightly mobile nutrients are those whose deficiencies are seen first in the middle and old growth, they include Sulphur, Manganese and Molybdenum.
      Immobile nutrients are those whose deficiencies are first seen on the new growth and they include; Calcium, Boron, Zinc, Iron and Copper.
    </p>
    <h4 class="sub_title" style="width: 80%; background-color: #fcfcfc;">What does a crop need to give us the optimal yield? </h4>
    <p>The Engineers behind creation of this system researched further to understand better how to improve its client crop health.
      Nutrients and their roles;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h5>Nitrogen</h5>
        <p>Ã˜ Itâ€™s the major component of protein hormones, vitamins, chlorophyll and enzymes. Important for vegetative growth. Its deficiency is characterized by chlorosis and stunted growth</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Phosphorus</h5>
        <p>Ã˜ Required for photosynthesis, protein formation and metabolism of plants. Essential for flower formation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Calcium</h5>
        <p>Ã˜ responsible for contributing to the building of cell walls in plants. When calcium is deficient,
          new tissue such as root tips, young leaves, and shoot tips often have
          improper cell wall formation causing visual distortion in new growth</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Sulphur</h5>
        <p>Ã˜ Essential for chlorophyll formation. Deficiency causes the leaves to appear light green in color
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Potassium</h5>
        <p>Ã˜ Necessary for cell division. Helps to adjust water balance, improves stem turgidity and hardness. Enhances color development of the petals. Deficiency results to curled or scorched leaves
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Iron</h5>
        <p> Ã˜ Necessary for enzyme activities
          Acts as a catalyst for synthesis of chlorophyll
          Deficiency causes yellowing of leaves</P>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Zinc</h5>
        <p>Ã˜ Essential for carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis
          Required for internodes elongation
          Deficient plants have irregular chlorotic areas
          Enhances synthesis of auxins-encourage apical dominance
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Boron</h5>
        <p> Ã˜ Boron is involved in the movement of Ca into the plant and in normal Ca nutrition
          in plants.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Manganese</h5>
        <p> Ã˜ Increases the availability of phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca).
          Manganese plays a vital role in photosynthesis by aiding in chlorophyll synthesis.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>chlorine</h5>
        <p> Ã˜ Chloride is needed in small quantities and aids in plant metabolism, photosynthesis, osmosis (movement of water in and out of plant cells) and ionic balance within the cell.
          In photosynthesis it is used in photolysis (splitting the water H and O2 molecule).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Magnesium</h5>
        <p> Ã˜ Magnesium is the central atom in the chlorophyll molecule. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Copper</h5>
        <p>Ã˜ Increases crop fertility </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Molybdenum</h5>
        <p>Ã˜ Helps in the conversion of nitrites into soluble nitrogen.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Combination Of Fertilizers Our System Uses To Achieve Best Ever Crop Quality

    <h4>Who the project was created for</h4>
		<p>FERT PPM is created to be used by all growers as their daily to use tool. This system will offer benefits to both cash crop and food crop growers by maximizing their yield and giving a guide to a better crop nutrition and fertilizers regimes. The main beneficiaries are horticultural growers
        Our focus was to build our knowledge in dealing with data rich applications, be comfortable working with databases and also learn how to manipulate code to create workable user interfaces.
        Why FERT PPM. Going into this project the only common ground we had was the fact that we were paired by ALX Software Engineering Program and that we were very willing
        to work on something.We started with a Planner that was intended to assist people with time management issues to be accountable for every hour they spend.
        We also had thoughts of utilizing a chatbot library to come up with a message relaying system, but when Benson mentioned FERT PPM, it sold both of us.
        Agriculture tech is not a world that is very expounded on especially in a country like Kenya. In addition we also reflected on how expensive fertilizers are and
        the fact that saving how much fertilizers are used is a possibility. Initially Benson had started creating the application but in a desktop environment.
        We felt like taking this application as our portfolio project would be a great learning opportunity.</p>
		<h4>What is Fertigation?</h4>
        <p>Fertigation is a term that combines two words: "fertilization" and "irrigation." It refers to the process of applying fertilizers and nutrients to plants through an irrigation system. Instead of applying fertilizers separately from irrigation water, fertigation allows for the simultaneous delivery of water and nutrients to crops.
          Fertigation System
          In a fertigation system, a liquid fertilizer solution or soluble fertilizers are mixed with water and distributed through an irrigation system, such as drip irrigation or sprinklers. This allows for precise and controlled application of nutrients directly to the plant's root zone. A lot of the fertigation systems currently in use, have fertilizer injectors that facilitate the distribution of fertilizers. While creating FERT PPM we assumed the injector system that would be used would be in relation to the units assimilated in the app.

          Fertigation offers several advantages over traditional methods of fertilization. It ensures a more efficient use of fertilizers since the nutrients are delivered directly to the plants' roots, reducing losses due to runoff or leaching. It also enables the farmer to adjust the nutrient levels according to the specific needs of different crops or growth stages, leading to optimal plant nutrition.

          Furthermore, fertigation allows for better nutrient uptake by plants since the application occurs during irrigation when the root system is more receptive. It provides a more uniform distribution of nutrients throughout the field, which can result in improved crop yield, quality, and consistency.

          Overall, fertigation is a technique that combines irrigation and fertilization, offering precision, efficiency, and flexibility in delivering nutrients to crops, making it a popular choice in modern agriculture practices.

    <h4>Technologies we used to come up with this system</h4>
    <p>To come up with FEET PPM we used quite a number of technologies.
    For the Frontend we chose to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and django template frameworks. We opted to use Django's template language because we wanted to strike a balance between power and ease when working with HTML.
    The Django framework enabled us to efficiently handle and generate dynamically HTML web pages that are visible to the end-user. Django mainly functions with a backend so, in order to provide a frontend and provide a layout to our website, we used templates.

    Our backend technology is built using python and django framework. We chose Django because it is a fast and simple framework that helps to save development time and therefore increase the overall cost-effectiveness of the project. Also, Django has one of the best out-of-the-box security systems out there. It helped us avoid common security issues that could otherwise incur additional costs later.
    We used MySQL database for the deployed app because MySQL is a reliable, easy-to-use, and secure RDBMS that is enterprise-ready with support from GPL and can scale with businesses after some fine-tuning and optimization. Reasons are plenty for MySQL's popularity. It's an accessible database management system with improved capability to deal with modern problems.
    website hosting services - Python web frameworks have become mainstream nowadays. Hugely successful websites are built on Django, Flask and other Python frameworks. We hosted our website on PythonAnywhere because it offers free website hosting for Python websites. PythonAnywhere is a web hosting company which offers hosting solutions for Python web applications. One can use it to host Python web apps and scripts. Itâ€™s a 7 years old company based in London.

  <div class="purpose_of_app">
    <h4>Feature</h4>
    <p>
      FERT PPM website is responsive and deployed. This means users can access the project from the web browser using the link
       <a href="https://fertppm.pythonanywhere.com/">https://fertppm.pythonanywhere.</a></p>

    <h4>CHALLENGES</h4>
     <h5>Technical challenges</h5>
     <p>To start with, we view our system as a full-stack web application. That said, it incorporates up to 5 front and backend languages and platforms, e.g. JavaScript, Python and Django, PHP, HTML, CSS among others. This makes it challenging to manage dependencies.
     Among the many bugs we encountered, the one that stood out for us was where we had to migrate the project to the deployment environment. The issue comes in getting the domain name to run in HTTPS protocol and SSH certificate.
     Considering that the project is big, the amount of time it took for deployment to be initialized was extensive.

     The challenges associated with managing project dependencies, implementing dynamic sorting and filtering, and handling file uploads were successfully overcome with a thorough study and adjustment of the project plan. The team remains vigilant and adapts to handle additional unforeseen complications.
    </p>

     <h5>Non-Technical challenges.</h5>

     <p>Based on the progress achieved in all our software development life cycle, project completion and MVP definition, several non technical challenges were being experienced:
     Considering that there were so many aspects of the project that need perfecting and the fact that we are working on a given time line, a bit of pressure was building up. We hope at the end of it all, we will meet the deadline and the app will be fully functional
     Efforts to improve collaboration and communication between team members have yielded positive results. Regular virtual meetings and the use of collaboration tools enabled smoother communication channels and minimized the impact of this non-technical challenge. However, our activities of daily living have been interfering with collaboration which delays our progress
